Program
---------

This workshop consists out of four parts:

* 30 minutes: Introduction to RDF and SPARQL ([presentation](/Presentation_introRDF.pdf))

* 25 minutes: Gene variants in Wikidata:
   * [Understanding the Basics](Assignments/assignment1A.md)
   * [Execute the query and retain results](Assignments/assignment1B.md)
   * [Expand and change Query](Assignments/assignment1C.md)
   
* 25 minutes: Drug Targets in Wikidata
   * [A more complicated query](Assignments/assignment2A.md)
   * [Answering Biological Questions](Assignments/assignment2B.md)
   
* 10 minutes: Recap
   * Other Biological databases with RDF ([presentation](/Presentation_introRDF.pdf))
   * Update your SPARQL query [here](https://github.com/BiGCAT-UM/SPARQLTutorialBioSB2019/tree/master/ParticipantQueries)

An [addendum](Assignments/AddendumBioSb2019.md) is available, where we added:
* Answers to questions asked during the tutorial.
* More information on where to find Biological and Chemical properties (aka relationships) to expand your query.
* More detailed explanation of the SERVICE statement (since this is not directly part of SPARQL, but constructed by Wikidata for easier querying).
